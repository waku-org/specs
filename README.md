There is no format/template for accepted specifications to the Waku RFC.

New specifications that are considered a proof of concept, 
should provide some implementation to help discussion.
If rough consensus is reached, 
the specification could be considered to receive a draft status at the Vac RFC repository.

**NOTE:** Specifications located in this repository should be considered not production ready.
Discussion should be conducted with the intention of maturing the specification.
