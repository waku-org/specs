# Waku Specifications

Waku builds a family of privacy-preserving, censorship-resistant communication protocols for web3 applications.
This repository contains specifications for the Waku suite of protocols.

## List of Specifications:

- Standards
  - Core: Standards and protocols for the core Waku p2p communications offering.
  - Application: Standards and protocols that describe various applications or encryption use cases built on top of a Waku network.
- Informational: Waku design issues, general guidelines or background information that does not constitute a new feature.

## Contributions 

Contributions are welcome from any party. 
Contributors can create specifications relating to the Waku domain and
create a pull request to begin discussion.

Please adhere to the following contribution guidelines:
- use the recommended [template](./template.md) for new proposed specifications
- use keywords as per the language recommendations in the [template](./template.md) and [Vac COSS](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/blob/a5b24ac0a27da361312260f9da372a0e6e812212/vac/1/coss.md#language)
- use [semantic breaks](https://sembr.org/)
- links to Waku, Vac or other [IFT](https://free.technology/)-related specifications must be to the corresponding Github repository and not to a webpage.
For example, Waku specs reside in [waku-org/specs](https://github.com/waku-org/specs) and Vac RFCs in [vacp2p/rfc-index](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/).
- we no longer use "v2" in the _name_ of new specifications (and existing spec names inconsistent with this rule will eventually be revised). For example, do not call your specification "Waku v2 New Protocol" but simply "Waku New Protocol"
- the _title_ of new specifications must be prefixed with `WAKU2-` to differentiate it from other projects' specs and previous RFC generations. For example, "Waku New Protocol" could be titled `WAKU2-NEW-PROTOCOL`.

New specifications are considered a proof of concept.
Once a rough consensus is reached towards stabilization, 
the specification may be considered to receive the draft status and 
further discussion will continue on the [Vac RFC-Index](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index) repository.

**NOTE:** Specifications located in this repository should be considered not production ready.
Discussion should be conducted with the intention of maturing each specification.

Head over to the [Vac RFC-Index](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index) repository where other Waku specifications live.
