## Contributions 

Contributions are welcome from any party. 
Contributors can create specifications relating to the Waku domain and
create a pull request to begin discussion.
The recommended template may be used for new proposed specifications.

New specifications are considered a proof of concept.
Once a rough consensus is reached towards stabilization, 
the specification may be considered to receive the draft status and 
further discussion will continue on the [Vac RFC-Index](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index) repository.

**NOTE:** Specifications located in this repository should be considered not production ready.
Discussion should be conducted with the intention of maturing each specification.
