## Abstract

This document specifies an Application Programming Interface (API) for Reliable Channel,
a high-level abstraction that provides eventual message consistency guarantees for all participants in a channel,
as well as message segmentation and rate limit management when using an underlying rate limited delivery protocol
with message size restrictions such as [WAKU2](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/blob/main/waku/standards/core/10/waku2.md).

The Reliable Channel is built on top of:
- [WAKU-API](/standards/application/waku-api.md) for Waku protocol integration
- [SDS](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/blob/main/vac/raw/sds.md) (Scalable Data Sync) for causal ordering and acknowledgements
- Message segmentation for handling large payloads
- Rate limit management for [WAKU2-RLN-RELAY](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/blob/main/waku/standards/core/17/rln-relay.md) compliance

The Reliable Channel API ensures that:

- All messages sent in a channel are eventually received by all participants
- Senders are notified when messages are acknowledged by other participants
- Missing messages are automatically detected and retrieved
- Message delivery is retried until acknowledged or maximum retry attempts are reached
- Messages are causally ordered using Lamport timestamps
- Large messages can be segmented to fit transport constraints
- Messages are queued or dropped when the underlying routing transport has a rate limit and said limit is being reached

## Motivation

While protocols like [SDS](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/blob/main/vac/raw/sds.md) provide the mechanisms for achieving reliability
(causal ordering, acknowledgements, missing message detection),
and [WAKU-API](/standards/application/waku-api.md) provides the transport layer,
there is a need for an opinionated, high-level API that makes these capabilities accessible and easy to use.

The Reliable Channel API provides this accessibility by:
- **Simplifying integration**: Wraps SDS, Waku protocols, and other components (segmentation, rate limiting) behind a single, cohesive interface
- **Providing sane defaults**: Pre-configures SDS parameters, retry strategies, and sync intervals for common use cases
- **Event-driven model**: Exposes message lifecycle through intuitive events rather than requiring manual polling of SDS state
- **Automatic task scheduling**: Handles the periodic execution of SDS tasks (sync, buffer sweeps) internally
- **Abstracting complexity**: Hides the details of:
  - SDS message wrapping/unwrapping
  - Store queries for missing messages
  - Message segmentation for large payloads
  - Rate limit compliance when using [WAKU2-RLN-RELAY](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/blob/main/waku/standards/core/17/rln-relay.md)

The goal is to enable application developers to achieve end-to-end reliability
with minimal configuration and without deep knowledge of the underlying protocols.
This follows the same philosophy as [WAKU-API](/standards/application/waku-api.md):
providing an opinionated, accessible interface to powerful but complex underlying mechanisms.

## Syntax

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## API design

### IDL

This specification uses the same custom Interface Definition Language (IDL) in YAML as defined in [WAKU-API](/standards/application/waku-api.md).

### Primitive types and general guidelines

The primitive types and general guidelines are the same as defined in [WAKU-API](/standards/application/waku-api.md#primitive-types-and-general-guidelines).

## Architecture

The Reliable Channel is a layered architecture that combines multiple components:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│      Reliable Channel API                                │ ← Application-facing event-driven API

│  Message Segmentation                                    │ ← Large message splitting/reassembly
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Rate Limit Manager                                      │ ← WAKU2-RLN-RELAY compliance & pacing
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SDS (Scalable Data Sync)                                │ ← Causal ordering & acknowledgements
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  WAKU-API (LightPush/Filter/Store/P2P Reliability)       │ ← Message transport layer
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### SDS integration

The Reliable Channel wraps the [SDS](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/blob/main/vac/raw/sds.md) `MessageChannel`, which provides:

- **Causal ordering**: Using Lamport timestamps to establish message order
- **Acknowledgments**: Via causal history (definitive) and bloom filters (probabilistic)
- **Missing message detection**: By tracking gaps in causal history
- **Buffering**: For unacknowledged outgoing messages and incoming messages with unmet dependencies

The Reliable Channel handles the integration between SDS and Waku protocols:
- Wrapping user payloads in SDS messages before encoding
- Unwrapping SDS messages after decoding (extracting `content` field)
- Subscribing to messages via the Waku node's unified subscribe API
- Receiving messages via the node's message emitter (content-topic based)
- Scheduling SDS periodic tasks (sync, buffer sweeps, process tasks)
- Mapping SDS events to user-facing events
- Computing retrieval hints (Waku message hashes) for SDS messages

### Message segmentation

For messages exceeding safe payload limits:
- Messages SHOULD be split into segments of approximately 100 KB
- The 100 KB limit accounts for overhead from:
  - Encryption (message-encryption layer)
  - [WAKU2-RLN-RELAY](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/blob/main/waku/standards/core/17/rln-relay.md) proof
  - SDS metadata (causal history, bloom filter, Lamport timestamp)
  - Protocol buffers encoding
- This ensures the final encoded Waku message stays well below the 150 KB routing layer limit
- Each segment SHOULD be tracked independently through SDS
- Segments SHOULD be reassembled before delivery to the application
- Partial message state SHOULD be managed to handle segment loss
- Segment order MUST be preserved during reassembly

TODO: refer to message segmentation spec

### Rate limit management

When using [WAKU2-RLN-RELAY](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/blob/main/waku/standards/core/17/rln-relay.md):
- Regular messages and segments exceeding the rate limit SHOULD be queued
- Ephemeral messages SHOULD be dropped (not sent nor queued) when the rate limit is approached or reached
- "Approached" threshold SHOULD be configurable (e.g., drop ephemerals at 90% capacity)
- Rate limit errors SHOULD be surfaced through events
- When segmentation is enabled, each segment counts toward the rate limit independently
- Messages coming from a retry mechanism should be queued when the rate limit is approached.

TODO: refer to rate limit manager spec

#### Extended definitions

**Default configuration values**: See the [SDS Implementation Suggestions](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/blob/main/vac/raw/sds.md#sdk-usage-reliablechannel) section for recommended default values for `ReliableChannelOptions`.

**`channel_id` and `sender_id`**:

The `channel_id` MUST be the same for all participants in a channel.
The `sender_id` SHOULD be unique for each participant and SHOULD be persisted between sessions to ensure proper acknowledgement tracking.

**`content_topic`**:

A Reliable Channel uses a unique content topic. This ensure that all messages are retrievable.

**`options.auto_start`**:

If set to `true` (default), the Reliable Channel SHOULD automatically call `start()` during creation.
If set to `false`, the application MUST call `start()` before the channel will process messages.

**`options.query_on_connect`**:

If set to `true` (default) and the Waku node has store capability,
the Reliable Channel SHOULD automatically query the store for missing messages when connecting to store nodes.
This helps ensure message consistency when participants come online after being offline.

### Send messages

#### Function definitions

```yaml
functions:
  send:
    description: "Send a message in the channel. The message will be retried if not acknowledged by other participants."
    parameters:
      - name: message_payload
        type: array<byte>
        description: "The message content to send (before SDS wrapping)."
    returns:
      type: MessageId
      description: "A unique identifier for the message, used to track events."

  sendEphemeral:
    description: "Send an ephemeral message in the channel. Ephemeral messages are not tracked for acknowledgement, not included in causal history, and are dropped when rate limits are approached or reached."
    parameters:
      - name: message_payload
        type: array<byte>
        description: "The message content to send (before SDS wrapping)."
    returns:
      type: MessageId
      description: "A unique identifier for the message, used to track events (limited to `message-sent` or `ephemeral-message-dropped` event)."

```

#### Extended definitions

**Event lifecycle**:

For each regular message sent via `send()`, the following event sequence is expected:

1. `sending-message`: Emitted each time chunks are sent, with cumulative array (MAY be emitted multiple times if retry mechanism kicks in)
   - Example progression for a 1-chunk message:
     - sendindg: `chunk_info={chunks: [0], total_chunks: 1}`
   - Example progression for a 5-chunk message:
     - First send: `chunk_info={chunks: [0], total_chunks: 5}`
     - Second send: `chunk_info={chunks: [0, 1], total_chunks: 5}`
     - Fifth send: `chunk_info={chunks: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], total_chunks: 5}`
2. `message-sent`: Emitted with same cumulative pattern as `sending-message` (MAY be emitted multiple times if retry mechanism kicks in)
3. `message-acknowledged`: Emitted each time new chunks are acknowledged
   - `chunk_info.chunks` array grows as chunks are acknowledged
   - Example progression for a 1-chunk message:
     - Only ack: `chunk_info={chunks: [0], total_chunks: 1}` (complete when `chunks.length == total_chunks`)
   - Example progression for a 5-chunk message:
     - First ack: `chunk_info={chunks: [0], total_chunks: 5}`
     - Second ack: `chunk_info={chunks: [0, 1], total_chunks: 5}`
     - Third ack: `chunk_info={chunks: [0, 1, 3], total_chunks: 5}` (chunk 2 still pending)
     - Fourth ack: `chunk_info={chunks: [0, 1, 2, 3], total_chunks: 5}` (chunk 2 now received)
     - Final ack: `chunk_info={chunks: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], total_chunks: 5}` (complete when `chunks.length == total_chunks`)
   - All events share the same `message_id`
   - Application can:
     - Check overall progress: `chunk_info.chunks.length / chunk_info.total_chunks` (e.g., 3/5 = 60%)
     - Check if complete: `chunk_info.chunks.length == chunk_info.total_chunks`
     - Track specific chunks: `chunk_info.chunks.includes(2)` to see if chunk 2 is done
     - Display which chunks remain: chunks not in the array

Alternatively, instead of `message-acknowledged`, the message lifecycle MAY end with:
   - `sending-message-irrecoverable-error`: Emitted if an unrecoverable error occurs

Optionally, before final acknowledgement:
   - `message-possibly-acknowledged`: (Probabilistic) MAY be emitted as bloom filter hits are detected

**For received messages**:
- `message-received`: Emitted **only once** after all chunks are received and reassembled. Note: we may want to provide progressive reception information.
- The payload is the complete-reassembled message
- No chunk information is provided (reassembly is transparent to the receiver)

For ephemeral messages sent via `sendEphemeral()`:
- Ephemeral messages are NEVER segmented (if too large, they are rejected)
  Rationale: Segmenting ephemeral messages would consume multiple rate limit slots without guarantees that all chunks get across, potentially wasting bandwidth on incomplete messages that provide no value to the application
- `message-sent`: Emitted once with `chunk_info={chunks: [0], total_chunks: 1}`
- `ephemeral-message-dropped`: Emitted if the message is dropped due to rate limit constraints
- `sending-message-irrecoverable-error`: Emitted if encoding, sending, or size check fails

**Irrecoverable errors**:

The following errors are considered irrecoverable and will trigger `sending-message-irrecoverable-error`:
- Encoding failed
- Empty payload
- Message size too large
- WAKU2-RLN-RELAY proof generation failed

When an irrecoverable error occurs, the retry mechanism SHOULD NOT attempt to resend the message.

### Channel lifecycle

#### Function definitions

```yaml
functions:
  start:
    description: "Start the Reliable Channel. Sets up event listeners, begins sync loop, starts missing message retrieval, and subscribes to messages via the Waku node."
    returns:
      type: void

  stop:
    description: "Stop the Reliable Channel. Stops sync loop, missing message retrieval, and clears intervals."
    returns:
      type: void
```

## Future improvements

- Developer may prefer to have control over the content topics for privacy and anonymity purposes, future improvements may enable this.
- Developers may prefer the message routing service (aka [WAKU2](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/blob/main/waku/standards/core/10/waku2.md)) to provide message rate limit information.
- "Query on connect" is most likely more suited at the [WAKU-API](/standards/application/waku-api.md) layer

## Security/Privacy considerations

1. **Encryption**: All participants in a Reliable Channel MUST be able to decrypt messages.
   Implementations SHOULD use the same encryption mechanisms for all messages.

2. **Sender identity**: The `sender_id` is used to differentiate acknowledgements.
   Implementations SHOULD ensure that acknowledgements are only considered valid when they originate from a different sender.

3. **Channel isolation**: Messages in different channels are isolated.
   A participant SHOULD only process messages that match their channel ID.

4. **Message ordering**: While the Reliable Channel ensures eventual consistency,
   it does not guarantee strict message ordering across participants.

5. **Resource exhaustion**: Implementations SHOULD implement limits on:
   - Number of missing messages tracked
   - Number of active retry attempts
   - Frequency of store queries

6. **Privacy**: Store queries reveal message interest patterns.
   Implementations MAY consider privacy-preserving retrieval strategies in the future.
