## Abstract
This specification describes how RLN, Rate Limit Nullifier, 
credentials are securely stored in a JSON schema.

## Summary
A keystore is a construct to store a user’s keys. 
The keys will be encrypted and decrypted based on methods specified in this specification. 
The keystore stores a user's credentials locally and
uses [32/RLN-V1](/spec/32/) as a spam-prevention mechanism by generating zero-knowledge proofs.

## Background
The secure storage of keys is important in peer-to-peer messaging applications.
A `WAKU-RLN-KEYSTORE` uses zero-knowledge proofs for anonymous rate-limiting for messaging frameworks. 
Generated credentials by a user are encrypted and stored in the keystore to be retrieved over a network.
With [32/RLN-V1](/spec/32/), sending and receiving 
messages will ensure a message rate for a network is being followed while preserving the anonymity of the message owner. 

### Waku RLN Keystore Format:

A format example of a keystore used by a [17/WAKU2-RLN-Relay](/spec/17/).

```js
const Keystore {
	application: "waku-rln-relay" ,
	appIdentifier: "string",
	version: "string",
	credentials: {
    		"membershipHash": {
      			crypto: {
        			cipher: "string",
        			cipherparams: {
					iv: "string",
				},
        			ciphertext: "string",
        			kdf: "string",
        			kdfparams: {
          				dklen: integer,
          				c: integer,
          				prf: "string",
          				salt: "string",
        			},
        			mac: "string",
      			}
    		}
	}
}

```

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, 
“NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

The keystore MUST be generated by a cryptographic construction with password verification and decryption.

Keystore modules MUST include metadata, key derivation function, checksum, cipher, and a membership hash.

### Metadata:
Information about the keystore SHOULD be stored in the metadata.

The declaration of `application`, `version`, and `appIdentifier` COULD occur in the metadata.

- `application` : current application, MUST be a string
- `version` : application version, MUST be a string, SHOULD follow semantic versioning
- `appIdentifier`: application identifier, MUST be a string

### Credentials:

After RLN credentials are generated, it MUST be stored in a JSON schema.
The Waku RLN credentials MUST consist of a `membershipHash` and `WakuCredential`.
The `membershipHash` will be an identity hash of the user.
The `WakuCredential` will store to encryption portion of the keystore.
There COULD be multiple credentials stored in a keystore, categorized by the `membershipHash`.

Each contruct MUST include the keypair:
> key: [`membershipHash`]: pair: [`WakuCredential`]

#### membershipHash

The `membershipHash` SHOULD be generated by user's participating in a membership group, 
as decribed in [32/RLN-V1](/spec/32/).
Each user SHOULD register to the group with an `identity_commitment` stored in a Merkle tree.
A cryptographic hash function that SHOULD be used to generate the `membershipHash` is [SHA256](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4634.txt),
other hash functions MAY be used.
The hash function that is used,
SHOULD be mentioned in the `verison` attribute.

To generate the `membershipHash`, 
the `treeIndex`, `membershipContract`, `chainId` and `identityCredential` attributes SHOULD be used to create a hexadecimal string.
- it MUST NOT already exist in the keystore.

##### `treeIndex`

After a user registers to a group, 
a `treeIndex` value of the position in the Merkle tree SHOULD be returned.
- it MUST be a Merkle tree data structure filled with `identity_commitment` from user registrations.
- it MUST be a hexadecimal string

##### `membershipContract`

For decentralized membership registrations, 
the `membershipContract` SHOULD be a `contractAddress` from a public blockchain using smart contracts. 
- it MUST be a string.

##### `chainId`
It uniquely defines the chain upon which the registration has occurred.
The `chainId` SHOULD be the blockchain identifier used for `membershipcontract`, 
as described in [EIP155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155).
- it MUST be a string

##### `identityCredential`

The `identityCredential` MUST be derived after a succussful decryption of the keystore.

The `identityCredential` MUST be constructed with the `identity_secret`, `identity_secret_hash`, `identity_commitment` values.
- it MUST be a hash of `identity_commitment` stored in a Merkle tree.
- it MUST be a string.

###### `identity_secret`

The `identity_secret` MUST be constructed with `identity_nullifier` + `identity_trapdoor` values. 
- `identity_nullifier` : Random 32 byte value
- `identity_trapdoor` : Random 32 byte value

###### `identity_secret_hash` 

Used to derive the `identity_commitment` of the user, and 
as a private input for zero-knowledge proof generation.
- it MUST be created with `identity_secret` as a parameter for the hash function.
- This secret hash SHOULD be kept private by the user.

###### `identity_commitment` 
- it SHOULD be created with `identity_secret_hash` by using the hash function Poseidon,
as described in [Poseidon Paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/458.pdf). 
- it MUST be used by a user for group registering.

#### WakuCredential

The `WakuCredential` will store values used for encrypting and decrypting user's keystores.
- it MUST be used for password verification.
- it MUST follow [EIP-2335](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2335)
- it SHOULD use [SHA256](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4634.txt) as the hash function


#### KDF

The password-based encryption used SHOULD be KDF, key derivation function, 
to produce a derived key from a password and other parameters.
The keystore COULD use PBKDF2 password-based encryption, 
as described in [RFC 2898](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2898.txt).

A `WakuCredential` object MUST include:
| Name | Description  |
|----|-----|
| password | used to encrypt keystore and decryption key |
| secret | key to be encrypted |
| pubKey | public key |
| path | HD, hardened derivation, path used to generate the secret |
| checksum | hash function | 
| cipher | cipher function |

```js

crypto: {
	
	cipher: "string" // The cipher function
	cipherparams: {
		iv: "string" // The cipher parameters
	},
	ciphertext: "string" // The cipher message,
	kdf: "string" // KDF Function,
	kdfparams: {
		param: integer // Salt value and iteration count,
		dklen: integer // Length in octets of derived key, MUST be positive integer,
		c: "string" // Iteration count, MUST be positive integer,
		prf: "string" // Underlying pseudorandom function,
		salt: "string" // Produces a large set of keys based on the password
	},
	mac: "string" // Checksum
}

```
	
#### Decryption
The keystore SHOULD decrypt a user's credentials using a password and the `membershipHash`, 
using PBKDF2 that returns the `decryptionKey` key.
The decryption key is used to verify the keystore is correct.
- To generate the `decryptionKey`, it MUST be constructed from a password and KDF,
as desrcibed in [ERC-2335: BLS12-381 Keystore](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2335).
- The `decryptionKey`, is derived from the cipher function and
cipher parameters described in the KDF used in the keystore.

### Test Vectors

RLN uses Poseidon hash algorithm to generate the `identityCredential`, 
as described in [Poseidon Paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/458.pdf).
The keystore hash algorithm used is [SHA256](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4634.txt).

- `application`: "waku-rln-relay"
- `appIdentifier`: "01234567890abcdef"

## Security Considerations
### 1.) Add a Password

An attacker can identify which credential belongs to a combination of `chainId` and 
`contractAddress` pair by brute forcing the `treeIndex` iteratively to find a hash match.
The RECOMMENDED solution is to add a password to the construction of `membershipHash` to prevent this attack.

The RECOMMENDED `membershipHash` Construction:
- `membershipHash` SHOULD be constructed with `treeIndex`, `membershipContract`, `identityCredential`, `membershipPassword`
	- `membershipPassword` : a new password created to private attacks compromising keystore credentials.
 - The user MUST store the `membershipPassword` privately.
